# Empathetic Communicator: soft skills, but without the fluff

> IT folks in 2025: learning Python, Docker, Kubernetes… and of course, polishing our soft skills (to get that juicier offer and a fatter paycheck of course💰).
> But here’s the catch- in our daily routine, it’s ridiculously easy to forget about empathy. Especially when someone replies “ok” without an emoji.

## Why bother)) ?

Empathy isn’t just for therapists or social workers. It’s also about:
- Fewer toxic conversations (and fewer people wanting to block you afterwards).
- More productive dialogues at work and in life.
- A little more humanity in a world where sometimes chatbots are more polite than people.

I personally ran into situations where I could be smart, logical, and efficient…  
but completely missed the moment when the other person was feeling bad

## 📱 What this app does

- Analyzes **text and voice** (offline, no cloud data slurping).
- Detects toxicity, passive aggression, or anxious tones.
- Suggests **emotionally constructive responses**.
- Teaches you little daily tips based on Nonviolent Communication.

## 🚀 Why offline?

Because:
- Data is personal.
- Internet isn’t always available (yes, even for IT people — shocker!).
- Speed matters: you need advice *now*, not after “Connecting…”.

## !! And what’s next

Honestly?  
Everything here right now is just a **teaser**.  
I’m working toward a bigger societal case:

> И не просто «rejected», а explained:  
> «У меня сейчас 3 кейс-чемпионата и 2 хакатона параллельно,

> И вообще, ты хороший человек, в жизни у тебя всё супер будет,  
> ты smart genious cute и hott.  
> Sooo давай через 3 недели поговорим, когда всё это закончится».  
>   
> How to channel that energy into something positive,  
> How to achieve more instead of sinking into rudeness or passive aggression,  
> How *not* to be a jerk and avoid blocking girls.  
> And don't be rude in the dormitory elevator просто за то, что она exists.  
> And не complain друзьям так, чтобы потом они ходили и  
> бросали на неё эти long judging взгляды в духе *«мы знаем, что ты сделала»* every time,  
> когда она проходит мимо.  
>   
> Spoiler ahead: Its not cool. Это awkward for everyone

Yes, this is also about communication, respect, and self-control.  
And about the fact that empathy and intelligence should go hand in hand.

**P.S.**  
If you’re an especialy an IT person reading this:  
Soft skills aren’t a 2-hour workshop you forget about afterwards.  
They’re something you can (and should) level up every single day.  
And yes empathy doesn’t get in the way of landing your dream offer
