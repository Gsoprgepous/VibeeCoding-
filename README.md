> IT folks in 2025: learning Python, Docker, Kubernetes… and of course, polishing our soft skills (to get that juicier offer and a fatter paycheck of course💰).
> But here’s the catch- in our daily routine, it’s ridiculously easy to forget about empathy. Especially when someone replies “ok” without an emoji.

## Why bother)) ?

Empathy isn’t just for therapists or social workers. It’s also about:
- Fewer toxic conversations (and fewer people wanting to block you afterwards).
- More productive dialogues at work and in life.
- A little more humanity in a world where sometimes chatbots are more polite than people.

I personally ran into situations where I could be smart, logical, and efficient…  
but completely missed the moment when the other person was feeling bad

## 📱 What this app does

- Analyzes **text and voice** (offline, no cloud data slurping).
- Detects toxicity, passive aggression, or anxious tones.
- Suggests **emotionally constructive responses**.
- Teaches you little daily tips based on Nonviolent Communication.

## 🚀 Why offline?

Because:
- Data is personal.
- Internet isn’t always available (yes, even for IT people — shocker!).
- Speed matters: you need advice *now*, not after “Connecting…”.


## Stack

- **Gemma 3n**  multimodal text + voice analysis.  
- **On-device ML**?? private and fast.  
- **UI** minimal, soft colors, friendly design Figma)).

**P.S.**  
If you’re an especialy an IT person reading this:  
Soft skills aren’t a 2-hour workshop you forget about afterwards.  
They’re something you can (and should) level up every single day.  
And yes empathy doesn’t get in the way of landing your dream offer
